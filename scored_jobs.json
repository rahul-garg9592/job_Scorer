Whether it's through rapid prototyping, cloud-native architectures, or cutting-edge LLMs, we believe in moving fast and building smart. Join us, and be part of a collaborative, future-focused team that\u2019s redefining what AI can do for the enterprise. Are you driven by curiosity and a passion for AI, Gen-AI, and data-driven innovation? Do you want to work at the forefront of AI development - building intelligent agents, optimizing scalable workflows, and applying cutting-edge models to real-world challenges? Key Responsibilities: Design and implement scalable, maintainable, and robust AI/ML systems. Build and fine-tune ML/DL models using core concepts like feature engineering, model evaluation, and architecture selection (e.g., CNNs, Transformers) to solve business problems. Work on agentic workflows and intelligent orchestration of LLMs using tools like LangChain or Semantic Kernel. Design and deploy RESTful APIs for AI services and intelligent pipelines. Integrate and evaluate vector databases (e.g., FAISS, Chroma, Pinecone) with LLMs for RAG-based systems. Validate and monitor AI models through rigorous testing (unit, integration, adversarial) ensuring generalization and fairness. Identify and mitigate risks related to bias, drift, and hallucinations in generative models. Deploy solutions to cloud environments (AWS, Azure, GCP) using CI/CD principles. Collaborate closely with cross-functional teams to translate business needs into AI-first solutions. Must-Have Skills & Qualifications: Bachelor's degree in engineering/technology. Final year engineering students with relevant skillsets and bandwidth can also apply. 0-1 year of industry experience in AI/ML development. Strong programming skills in Python, with experience in FastAPI. Good understanding of core ML/DL concepts: supervised/unsupervised learning, overfitting, regularization, CNNs, Transformers, etc. Experience with SQL and basic data engineering principles. Familiarity with foundational Gen-AI concepts (e.g., embeddings, prompting, fine-tuning) and models (ChatGPT, LLaMA 2/3, Mistral, Claude, etc.). Exposure to frameworks like LangChain or LlamaIndex. Understanding of agent-based workflows and AI task automation. Analytical mindset and strong debugging/problem-solving skills. Good communication and collaboration abilities in a remote work environment. Preferred Skills: Knowledge of RLHF, prompt engineering, few-shot learning. Experience with data labelling, evaluation frameworks, and synthetic data generation. Understanding of monitoring tools for model performance, latency, and observability. Working knowledge of cloud deployments and containerization (Docker, basic Kubernetes is a plus). Why Join SolvusAI? Work at the cutting edge of applied AI and Gen-AI. Collaborate with a high-energy, impact-driven team. Flexible remote environment. Ownership and visibility across projects from day one. Opportunity to shape the future of intelligent automation.
